AI Based Tic Tac Toe Game
In this project, I built a "mini-brain" using only Python math.
How it works: At first, the computer was just guessing and making many mistakes.
How it learned: Every time it made a mistake, the code corrected it slightly. This is called training.
The Result: After practicing almost 5,000 times, the computer stopped guessing and actually "learned" the right answers.
